\section{Copyright \& Creative Commons (10 points)}

\subsection{Differences}
On what grounds can you differentiate between Copyright and Creative Commons?

\subsubsection{Case Study}
Let us consider that Donald has an idea to develop a study material for the poor  children from his area who cannot attend a school. But in order to have this idea as a product, he needs some financial help from investors so that he can collect materials and also to set up a website where kids can study for free using the materials and videos he makes for them. But Donald wants it to be completely free and shareable so that it can help anyone. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Can Donald's \emph{idea} be copyrighted?
\item How can Donald protect his idea when he presents it to the investors?
\item Since the investors are investing capital, can they still recover money if Donald wants to go for the Creative Common licenses? If so, state the ways?  
\end{itemize}

\section{Neutrality(10 points)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Define the term \emph{net neutrality}.
\item Argue for and against the motion on the concept of priority pricing as discussed in Kögler et.al(2011)\footnote{\label{note1}Berger-Kögler, U. and Kruse, J. (2011) ‘Net neutrality regulation of the internet?’, Int. J. Management and Network Economics, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp.3–23.}
\item - Explain why?\quote{"...additional internet capacity would not lead to additional revenues because of the flat rates."}\textsuperscript{\ref{note1}}

\end{itemize}
